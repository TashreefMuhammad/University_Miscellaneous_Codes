# University Miscellaneous Codes

The contents in this reposiory are mainly the works I have done in different courses in my undergrad courses at my University. Most of the codes were assignments that I wrote myself and not complete **bug-free**. There are bugs in many of the codes, so use it with your own risk.

However, you can take an idea or skeleton on how it is used. But remeber to read thoroughly andf fix bugs.
